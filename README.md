# Welcome Mobile Friendly Bitwise Final Project

# What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework & is meant for developing mobile friendly websites with relative ease. A CSS Framework is essentially a library of CSS files that is put together to make it simpler for a developer to create amazing sites without the hassle of having to come up with classes and styling every single time a new project comes up
 

# What is Going on?
I decided to go with a Zelda theme site. Don’t remember if it needed to be more professional like or something we just wanted to create. I enjoy the Animation parts of CSS. We were introduced to SASS and SCSS for a moment.  


# Let’s begin with the Navbar/Logo
Even though I like Hamburgers, I wanted something different. I went with the Trifoce as the Logo, don’t sue me Nintendo. Just wanted it to stay collapse even on large screens. On click event, it drops down he menu. Top section with Home, Story, and Footer takes you to the different sections of the page. The bottom section of the NavBar takes you to my Website for Beginners site I created.
# Flashing Jumbotron
I found some interesting information regarding "Filter." Adding it to my CSS Animation. I used the opening image from Legend of Zelda. I figured I would remove each section separately. and keep it all the same size. These would be the Mountains and waterfall. The background with the title was removed completely. I applied a background to the mountain image and cropped out the waterfall section on the background. I added Lighting Bolts to the background. The light source has to come from somewhere.

# Roaring Waterfall
The Waterfall needed some animation. I copied the Waterfall image and placed a few layers on top, to extend the hieght. Probably not the best way to go about it. I shifted the waterfall down during the animation and resent it. Issue I had was overflow did not want to hide the extra waterfall flowing down. The background image connected to the mountains solved it from being seen until it flows downward. 

# Clouds and Text
The clouds were created used SVG. I copied the image and placed multiple copies of it laid across the image width. Problem here was I used the same size of the image from legend of Zelda. This kept the clouds boxed shaped at the ends. I just didn't want to go back and adjust it. I moved both clouds and text with CSS animation, added a bit of flash effect to them also. They move in opposite direction during the animation.

# Carousel
This is an interesting item from Bootstrap. But it has its drawbacks. Now the original Arrows to point to the next area was unacceptable. I decided to remove them and have Link pointing his sword in the direction. It also doesn’t have a way to stop it from sliding without additional code. I think the intervals should be included with the basic code. I added the background image as an old scroll. Figured this would be a good way to display the message part of the site. It took several adjusting to get the text to fit and Link to stay in place.
